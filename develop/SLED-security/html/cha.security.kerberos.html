   An open network provides no means of ensuring that a workstation can
   identify its users properly, except through the usual password
   mechanisms. In common installations, the user must enter the
   password each time a service inside the network is accessed. Kerberos
   provides an authentication method with which a user registers only
   once and is trusted in the complete network for the rest of the
   session. To have a secure network, the following requirements must
   be met:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist "><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem "><p>
     Have all users prove their identity for each desired service and
     make sure that no one can take the identity of someone else.
    </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
     Make sure that each network server also proves its identity.
     Otherwise an attacker might be able to impersonate the server and
     obtain sensitive information transmitted to the server. This
     concept is called <span class="emphasis"><em>mutual authentication</em></span>,
     because the client authenticates to the server and vice versa.
    </p></li></ul></div><p>
   Kerberos helps you meet these requirements by providing strongly
   encrypted authentication. Only the basic principles of Kerberos are
   discussed here. For detailed technical instruction, refer to the
   Kerberos documentation.
  </p></div><div class="sect1 " id="sec.security.kerberos.terms"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="sec.security.kerberos.terms"><span class="number">6.2 </span><span class="name">Kerberos Terminology</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha.security.kerberos.html#sec.security.kerberos.terms">#</a></h2></div></div></div><p>
   The following glossary defines some Kerberos terminology.
  </p><div class="variablelist "><dl class="variablelist"><dt id="idm139881286773712"><span class="term ">credential</span></dt><dd><p>
      Users or clients need to present some kind of credentials that authorize
      them to request services. Kerberos knows two kinds of
      credentials—tickets and authenticators.
     </p></dd><dt id="idm139881286771744"><span class="term ">ticket</span></dt><dd><p>
      A ticket is a per-server credential used by a client to
      authenticate at a server from which it is requesting a service. It
      contains the name of the server, the client's name, the client's
      Internet address, a time stamp, a lifetime, and a random session key.
      All this data is encrypted using the server's key.
     </p></dd><dt id="idm139881286769616"><span class="term ">authenticator</span></dt><dd><p>
      Combined with the ticket, an authenticator is used to prove that the
      client presenting a ticket is really the one it claims to be. An
      authenticator is built using the client's name, the workstation's IP
      address, and the current workstation's time, all encrypted with the
      session key known only to the client and the relevant server. An
      authenticator can only be used once, unlike a ticket. A client can build
      an authenticator itself.
     </p></dd><dt id="idm139881286767360"><span class="term ">principal</span></dt><dd><p>
      A Kerberos principal is a unique entity (a user or service) to which it
      can assign a ticket. A principal consists of the following components:
     </p><div class="verbatim-wrap"><pre class="screen"><em class="replaceable ">USER</em>/<em class="replaceable ">INSTANCE</em>@<em class="replaceable ">REALM</em></pre></div><div class="itemizedlist "><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem "><p><span class="formalpara-title">primary: </span>
         The first part of the principal. In the case of users, this is
         usually the same as the user name.
        </p></li><li class="listitem "><p><span class="formalpara-title">instance <span class="emphasis"><em>(optional)</em></span>: </span>
         Additional information characterizing the
         <span class="emphasis"><em>primary</em></span>. This string is separated from the
         <span class="emphasis"><em>primary</em></span> by a <code class="literal">/</code>.
        </p><p>
       <code class="literal">tux@example.org</code> and
       <code class="literal">tux/admin@example.org</code> can both exist on the same
       Kerberos system and are treated as different principals.
       </p></li><li class="listitem "><p><span class="formalpara-title">realm: </span>
         Specifies the Kerberos realm. Normally, your realm is your domain
         name in uppercase letters.
        </p></li></ul></div></dd><dt id="idm139881286754640"><span class="term ">mutual authentication</span></dt><dd><p>
      Kerberos ensures that both client and server can be sure of each
      other's identity. They share a session key, which they can use to
      communicate securely.
     </p></dd><dt id="idm139881286752688"><span class="term ">session key</span></dt><dd><p>
      Session keys are temporary private keys generated by Kerberos. They are
      known to the client and used to encrypt the communication between the
      client and the server for which it requested and received a ticket.
     </p></dd><dt id="idm139881286750672"><span class="term ">replay</span></dt><dd><p>
      Almost all messages sent in a network can be eavesdropped, stolen, and
      resent. In the Kerberos context, this would be most dangerous if an
      attacker manages to obtain your request for a service containing your
      ticket and authenticator. The attacker could then try to resend it
      (<span class="emphasis"><em>replay</em></span>) to impersonate you. However, Kerberos
      implements several mechanisms to deal with this problem.
     </p></dd><dt id="idm139881286748048"><span class="term ">server or service</span></dt><dd><p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Service</em></span> is used to refer to a specific action to
      perform. The process behind this action is called a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span>.
     </p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect1 " id="sec.security.kerberos.how"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="sec.security.kerberos.how"><span class="number">6.3 </span><span class="name">How Kerberos Works</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha.security.kerberos.html#sec.security.kerberos.how">#</a></h2></div></div></div><p>
   Kerberos is often called a third-party trusted authentication service,
   which means all its clients trust Kerberos's judgment of another client's
   identity. Kerberos keeps a database of all its users and their private
   keys.
  </p><p>
   To ensure Kerberos is working correctly, run both the authentication and
   ticket-granting server on a dedicated machine. Make sure that only the
   administrator can access this machine physically and over the network.
   Reduce the (networking) services running on it to the absolute
   minimum—do not even run
   <code class="systemitem">sshd</code>.
  </p><div class="sect2 " id="sec.security.kerberos.how.contact"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="sec.security.kerberos.how.contact"><span class="number">6.3.1 </span><span class="name">First Contact</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha.security.kerberos.html#sec.security.kerberos.how.contact">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
    Your first contact with Kerberos is quite similar to any login procedure
    at a normal networking system. Enter your user name. This piece of
    information and the name of the ticket-granting service are sent to the
    authentication server (Kerberos). If the authentication server knows
    you, it generates a random session key for further use between your
    client and the ticket-granting server. Now the authentication server
    prepares a ticket for the ticket-granting server. The ticket contains
    the following information—all encrypted with a session key only
    the authentication server and the ticket-granting server know:
   </p><div class="itemizedlist "><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem "><p>
      The names of both, the client and the ticket-granting server
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      The current time
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      A lifetime assigned to this ticket
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      The client's IP address
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      The newly-generated session key
     </p></li></ul></div><p>
    This ticket is then sent back to the client together with the session
    key, again in encrypted form, but this time the private key of the
    client is used. This private key is only known to Kerberos and the
    client, because it is derived from your user password. Now that the
    client has received this response, you are prompted for your password.
    This password is converted into the key that can decrypt the package
    sent by the authentication server. The package is
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">unwrapped</span>”</span> and password and key are erased from the
    workstation's memory. As long as the lifetime given to the ticket used
    to obtain other tickets does not expire, your workstation can prove your
    identity.
   </p></div><div class="sect2 " id="sec.security.kerberos.how.request"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="sec.security.kerberos.how.request"><span class="number">6.3.2 </span><span class="name">Requesting a Service</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha.security.kerberos.html#sec.security.kerberos.how.request">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
    To request a service from any server in the network, the client
    application needs to prove its identity to the server. Therefore, the
    application generates an authenticator. An authenticator consists of the
    following components:
   </p><div class="itemizedlist "><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem "><p>
      The client's principal
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      The client's IP address
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      The current time
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      A checksum (chosen by the client)
     </p></li></ul></div><p>
    All this information is encrypted using the session key that the client
    has already received for this special server. The authenticator and the
    ticket for the server are sent to the server. The server uses its copy
    of the session key to decrypt the authenticator, which gives it all the
    information needed about the client requesting its service, to compare
    it to that contained in the ticket. The server checks if the ticket and
    the authenticator originate from the same client.
   </p><p>
    Without any security measures implemented on the server side, this stage
    of the process would be an ideal target for replay attacks. Someone
    could try to resend a request stolen off the net some time before. To
    prevent this, the server does not accept any request with a time stamp
    and ticket received previously. In addition to that, a request with a
    time stamp differing too much from the time the request is received is
    ignored.
   </p></div><div class="sect2 " id="sec.security.kerberos.how.mutual"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="sec.security.kerberos.how.mutual"><span class="number">6.3.3 </span><span class="name">Mutual Authentication</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha.security.kerberos.html#sec.security.kerberos.how.mutual">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
    Kerberos authentication can be used in both directions. It is not only a
    question of the client being the one it claims to be. The server should
    also be able to authenticate itself to the client requesting its
    service. Therefore, it sends an authenticator itself. It adds one to the
    checksum it received in the client's authenticator and encrypts it with
    the session key, which is shared between it and the client. The client
    takes this response as a proof of the server's authenticity and they
    both start cooperating.

    Tickets are designed to be used for one server at a time.  Therefore, you
    need to get a new ticket each time you request another service. Kerberos
    implements a mechanism to obtain tickets for individual servers. This
    service is called the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">ticket-granting service</span>”</span>. The
    ticket-granting service is a service (like any other service mentioned
    before) and uses the same access protocols that have already been
    outlined. Any time an application needs a ticket that has not already been
    requested, it contacts the ticket-granting server.  This request consists
    of the following components:
   </p><div class="itemizedlist "><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem "><p>
      The requested principal
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      The ticket-granting ticket
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      An authenticator
     </p></li></ul></div><p>
    Like any other server, the ticket-granting server now checks the
    ticket-granting ticket and the authenticator. If they are considered
    valid, the ticket-granting server builds a new session key to be used
    between the original client and the new server. Then the ticket for the
    new server is built, containing the following information:
   </p><div class="itemizedlist "><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem "><p>
      The client's principal
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      The server's principal
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      The current time
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      The client's IP address
     </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
      The newly-generated session key
     </p></li></ul></div><p>
    The new ticket has a lifetime, which is either the remaining lifetime of
    the ticket-granting ticket or the default for the service. The lesser of
    both values is assigned. The client receives this ticket and the session
    key, which are sent by the ticket-granting service. But this time the
    answer is encrypted with the session key that came with the original
    ticket-granting ticket. The client can decrypt the response without
    requiring the user's password when a new service is contacted. Kerberos
    can thus acquire ticket after ticket for the client without bothering
    the user.
   </p></div></div><div class="sect1 " id="sec.security.kerberos.users"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="sec.security.kerberos.users"><span class="number">6.4 </span><span class="name">User View of Kerberos</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha.security.kerberos.html#sec.security.kerberos.users">#</a></h2></div></div></div><p>
   Ideally, a user only contact with Kerberos happens during login
   at the workstation. The login process includes obtaining a
   ticket-granting ticket. At logout, a user's Kerberos tickets are
   automatically destroyed, which makes it difficult for anyone else to
   impersonate this user.
  </p><p>
   The automatic expiration of tickets can lead to a situation when a user's login session lasts longer than the maximum
   lifespan given to the ticket-granting ticket (a reasonable setting is 10
   hours). However, the user can get a new ticket-granting ticket by running
   <code class="command">kinit</code>. Enter the password again and Kerberos obtains
   access to desired services without additional authentication. To get a
   list of all the tickets silently acquired for you by Kerberos, run
   <code class="command">klist</code>.
  </p><p>
   Here is a short list of applications that use Kerberos authentication.
   These applications can be found under
   <code class="filename">/usr/lib/mit/bin</code> or
   <code class="filename">/usr/lib/mit/sbin</code> after installing the package
   <code class="systemitem">krb5-apps-clients</code>. They all have the full
   functionality of their common Unix and Linux brothers plus the additional
   bonus of transparent authentication managed by Kerberos:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist "><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem "><p>
     <code class="command">telnet</code>,
     <code class="systemitem">telnetd</code>
    </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
     <code class="command">rlogin</code>
    </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
     <code class="command">rsh</code>, <code class="command">rcp</code>,
     <code class="systemitem">rshd</code>
    </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
     <code class="command">ftp</code>, <code class="systemitem">ftpd</code>
    </p></li></ul></div><p>
   You no longer need to enter your password for using these applications
   because Kerberos has already proven your identity.
   <code class="command">ssh</code>, if compiled with Kerberos support, can even
   forward all the tickets acquired for one workstation to another one. If
   you use <code class="command">ssh</code> to log in to another workstation,
   <code class="command">ssh</code> makes sure that the encrypted contents of the
   tickets are adjusted to the new situation. Simply copying tickets between
   workstations is not sufficient because the ticket contains
   workstation-specific information (the IP address). XDM and GDM offer
   Kerberos support, too. Read more about the Kerberos network applications

   Most NFS servers can export filesystems using any combination of
   the default "trust the network" form of security known as
   <code class="option">sec=sys</code>, and three different levels of Kerberos-based
   security, <code class="option">sec=krb5</code>, <code class="option">sec=krb5i</code> and
   <code class="option">sec=krb5p</code>. The <code class="option">sec</code> option is set
   as a mount option on the client. Is it often the case that NFS
   service will first be configured and used with
   <code class="option">sec=sys</code>, and then Kerberos can be imposed afterwards.
   In this case it is likely that the server will be configured to
   support both <code class="option">sec=sys</code> and one of the Kerberos levels,
   and then after all clients have transitioned, the
   <code class="option">sec=sys</code> support will be removed, thus achieving
   true security. The transition to Kerberos should be fairly transparent
   if done in an orderly manner. However there is one subtle detail of
   NFS behavior that works differently when Kerberos is used, and the
   implications of this need to be understand and possibly addressed.
   See <a class="xref" href="cha.security.kerberos.html#sec.security.kerberos.overview.group" title="6.6.1. Group Membership">Section 6.6.1, “Group Membership”</a>.
  </p><p>
   The three Kerberos levels indicate different levels of security. With
   more security comes a need for more processor power to encrypt and
   decrypt messages. Choosing the right balance is an important
   consideration that should go in to planning a roll-out of Kerberos for
   NFS.
  </p><p>
   <code class="literal">krb5</code> provides only authentication. The server
   can know who sent a request, and the client can know that the
   server did send a reply. No security is provided for the content of
   the request or reply so an attacker with physical network access
   could transform the request or reply, or both, in arbitrary ways to
   deceive either server or client. They cannot directly read or
   change any file that the authenticated user could not read or
   change, but almost anything is theoretically
  possible.
  </p><p>
   <code class="literal">krb5i</code> adds integrity checks to all messages.
   With <code class="literal">krb5i</code>, an attacker cannot modify any
   request or reply, but they can view all the data exchanged, and so
   could discover the content of any file that is read.
  </p><p>
   <code class="literal">krb5p</code> adds privacy to the protocol. As well as
   reliable authentication and integrity checking, messages are fully
   encrypted so an attacker can only know that messages were exchanged
   between client and server, and cannot extract other information
   directly from the message. Whether information can be extracted
   from message timing is a separate question that Kerberos does not
   address.
  </p><div class="sect2 " id="sec.security.kerberos.overview.group"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="sec.security.kerberos.overview.group"><span class="number">6.6.1 </span><span class="name">Group Membership</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha.security.kerberos.html#sec.security.kerberos.overview.group">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
    The one behavioral difference between <code class="option">sec=sys</code> and
    the various Kerberos security levels that might be visible is related
    to group membership. In Unix and Linux, each filesystem access
    comes from a process which is owned by a particular user and has a
    particular group owner, and a number of supplemental groups. Access
    rights to files can vary based on the owner and the various groups.
   </p><p>
    With <code class="option">sec=sys</code>, the user-id, group-id, and a list of
    up to 16 supplemental groups are sent to the server in each
    request.
   </p><p>
    If a user is a member of more that 16 supplemental groups, the
    extra groups are lost and some files may not be accessible over NFS
    that the user would normally expect to have access to. For this
    reason, most sites that use NFS find a way to limit all users to at
    most 16 supplemental groups.
   </p><p>
    If the user runs the <code class="command">newgrp</code> command or runs a
    set-group-id program, either of which can change the list of groups
    they are a member of, these changes take effect immediately and
    provide different accesses over NFS.
   </p><p>
    With Kerberos, group information is not sent in requests at all. Only
    the user is identified (using a Kerberos "Principal"), and the server
    performs a lookup to determine the user ID and group list for that
    principal. This means that if the user is a member of more than 16
    groups, all of these group memberships will be used in determining
    file access permissions. However it also means that if the user
    changes a group-id on the client in some way, the server will not
    notice the change and will not take that it into account in
    determining access rights.
   </p><p>
    Is most cases, the improvement of having access to more groups
    brings a real benefit, and the loss of not being able to change
    groups is not noticed as it is not widely used. A site
    administrator considering the use of Kerberos should be aware of the
    difference though and ensure that it will not actually cause
    problems.
   </p></div><div class="sect2 " id="sec.security.kerberos.overview.performance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="sec.security.kerberos.overview.performance"><span class="number">6.6.2 </span><span class="name">Performance and Scalability</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha.security.kerberos.html#sec.security.kerberos.overview.performance">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
    Using Kerberos for security requires extra CPU power for encrypting
    and decrypting messages. How much extra CPU power is required and
    whether the difference is noticeable will vary with different
    hardware and different applications. If the server or client are
    already saturating the available CPU power, it is likely that a
    performance drop will be measurable when switching from sec=sys to
    Kerberos. If there is spare CPU capacity available, it is quite
    possible that the transition will not result in any throughput
    change. The only way to be sure how much impact the use of Kerberos
    will have is to test your load on your hardware.
   </p><p>
    The only configuration options that might reduce the load will also
    reduce the quality of the protection offered.
    <code class="option">sec=krb5</code> should produce noticeably less load than
    <code class="option">sec=krb5p</code> but, as discussed above, it doesn't
    produce very strong security. Similarly it is possible to adjust
    the list of ciphers that Kerberos can choose from, and this might
    change the CPU requirement. However the defaults are carefully
    chosen and should not be changed without similar careful
    consideration.
   </p><p>
    The other possible performance issue when configuring NFS to use
    Kerberos involves availability of the Kerberos authentication servers,
    known as the KDC or Key Distribution Center.
   </p><p>
    The use of NFS adds load to such servers to the same degree that
    adding the use of Kerberos for any other services adds some load.
    Every time a given user (Kerberos principal) establishes a
    session with a service, for example by accessing files
    exported by a particular NFS server, the client needs to negotiate
    with the KDC. Once a session key has been negotiated, the client
    server can communicate without further help for many hours,
    depending on details of the Kerberos configuration, particularly the
    <code class="option">ticket_lifetime</code> setting.
   </p><p>
    The concerns most likely to affect the provisioning of Kerberos KDC
    servers are availability and peak usage.
   </p><p>
    As with other core services such as DNS, LDAP or similar
    name-lookup services, having two servers that are reasonably
    "close" to every client provides good availability for modest
    resources. Kerberos allows for multiple KDC servers with flexible
    models for database propagation, so distributing servers as needed
    around campuses, buildings, and even cabinets is fairly straight
    forward. The best mechanism to ensure each client finds a near-by
    Kerberos server is to use split-horizon DNS with each building (or
    similar) getting different details from the DNS server. If this is
    not possible, then managing the <code class="filename">/etc/krb5.conf</code>
    file to be different at different locations is a suitable
    alternative.
   </p><p>
    As access to the Kerberos KDC is infrequent, load is only likely to be
    a problem at peak times. If thousands of people all log in between
    9:00 and 9:05, then the servers will receive many more
    requests-per-minute than they might in the middle of the night. The
    load on the Kerberos server is likely to be more than that on an LDAP
    server, but not orders of magnitude more. A sensible guideline is
    to provision Kerberos replicas in the same manner that you provision
    LDAP replicas, and then monitor performance to determine if demand
    ever exceeds capacity.
   </p></div><div class="sect2 " id="sec.security.kerberos.overview.kdc"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="sec.security.kerberos.overview.kdc"><span class="number">6.6.3 </span><span class="name">Master KDC, Multiple Domains, and Trust Relationships</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="cha.security.kerberos.html#sec.security.kerberos.overview.kdc">#</a></h3></div></div></div><p>
    One service of the Kerberos KDC that is not easily distributed is
    the handling of updates, such as password changes and new user
    creation. These much happen at a single master KDC.
   </p><p>
    These updates are not likely to happen with such frequency that any
    significant load will be generated, but availability could be an
    issue. It can be annoying if you want to create a new user or change
    a password, and the master KDC on the other side of the world is
    temporarily unavailable.
   </p><p>
    When an organization is geographically distributed and has a policy
    of handling administration tasks locally at each site, it can be
    beneficial to create multiple Kerberos domains, one for each
    administrative center. Each domain would then have its own master
    KDC which would be geographically local. Users in one domain can
    still get access to resources in another domain by setting up trust
    relationships between domains.
   </p><p>
    The easiest arrangement for multiple domains is to have a global
    domain (e.g. EXAMPLE.COM) and various local domains (e.g.
    ASIA.EXAMPLE.COM, EUROPE.EXAMPLE.COM, etc). If the global domain is
    configured to trust each local domain, and each local domain is
    configured to trust the global domain, then fully transitive trust
    is available between any pair of domains, and any principal can
    establish a secure connection with any service. Ensuring
    appropriate access rights to resources, for example files, provided
    by that service will be dependent on the user name lookup service
    used, and the functionality of the NFS file server, and is beyond
    the scope of this document.
