   The <span class="productname"><span class="phrase">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</span></span> Security and Hardening Guide deals with the particulars of
   installation and set up of a secure <span class="productname"><span class="phrase">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</span></span> and additional
   post-install processes required to further secure and harden that
   installation. Security and hardening elements and procedures are best
   applied to a server both during installation and post-installation and aim
   to improve the fitness of the system for the purposes demanded by its
   administrator.
  </p><p>
   This guide supports administrator in making security related choices and
   decisions. The individual steps and procedures should be seen as proposals,
   not as strict rules. You will often need to evaluate the usefulness of
   measures for your organization yourself.
  </p><p>
   The objective is to improve the security value of the system. Definitions
   about the meaning of the term security vary, but we want to settle on one
   that is both simple and abstract:
  </p><p>
   <span class="emphasis"><em>A good system does what it is expected to do, and it does it
   well.</em></span>
  </p><p>
   <span class="emphasis"><em>A secure system is a good system that does nothing
   else.</em></span>
  </p><p>
   The focus of this guide lies on doing <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">nothing else</span>”</span>. The Linux
   system is constructed in such way that security policies are enforced. These
   policies consist of the following concepts (fairly generic and incomplete
   list):
  </p><div class="itemizedlist "><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem "><p>
     DAC (Discretionary Access Control): File and directory permissions, as set
     by <code class="command">chmod</code> and <code class="command">chown</code>.
    </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
     Privileged ports: TCP and UDP ports 0-1023 and raw sockets can only be
     used by <code class="systemitem">root</code>.
    </p></li><li class="listitem "><p>
     Other privileged operations: Loading kernel modules, configuring network
     interfaces, all security relevant settings of the Linux kernel. These are
     operations that can only be done by the root user, that is the user with
     the user ID 0, or any other process with the necessary capabilities.
    </p></li></ul></div><p>
   Attacking a system means to attempt to overcome privilege boundaries, for
   example by circumventing or breaking them. That means the administrator or
   programmer of the system has not anticipated this scenario.
  </p><p>
   A hardened system raises the bar by reducing the area that the system
   exposes to the attacker (often called attack surface). A hardened system can
   also provide measures to reduce the impact of vulnerabilities in the parts
   of the systems that must be exposed to a potential attacker.
  </p><p>
   Security is about decisions, and whenever security is in (apparent)
   opposition to function, these decisions become trade-offs. While it can be
   argued that all systems should be set up to be as securely as possible, some
   levels of security and hardening may very well be overkill in some cases.
   Each system's operational environment has its own security requirements
   derived from business drivers or regulatory compliance mandates. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server can,
   for example, be configured to comply with security standards, such as SOX,
   HIPAA and PCIDSS. It can also be set up to fulfill the requirements from the
   German Federal Office of Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in
   der Informationstechnik) as described in BSI TR-02102-1. An effective
   business requirements analysis should be performed to determine the right
   level of security and hardening to be applied to a server or defined as part
   of a baseline server build.
  </p><p>
   As a final note before we begin: You may encounter individual requirements
   in regulatory compliance frameworks that may not make sense from a technical
   perspective, or they do not serve the purpose of improving security. It may
   be a productive attitude to simply implement what is required, but whenever
   there is a contradiction to security, an informed discussion in the
   documentation serves the overall purpose of your regulative compliance
   framework much more than blindly obeying the specifications. Feel encouraged
   to dispute list items that you think are counterproductive.
  </p><div class="sect1 " id="pre.hardening.about.assumptions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="pre.hardening.about.assumptions"><span class="number">1 </span><span class="name">Assumptions and Scope</span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="pre.hardening.about.html#pre.hardening.about.assumptions">#</a></h2></div></div></div><p>
    References in this document will usually be made to a single server target
    or host, however the scope can generally be applied to more than one
    machine. We generally assume that the security target can cover one or more
    systems running <span class="productname"><span class="phrase">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</span></span>.
   </p><p>
    We explicitly do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> make any assumptions about the
    hostility of the network that the systems are connected to, or the
    cooperative nature of the users that leverage the services provided by the
    systems.
   </p><p>
    In turn, this means that you partially define your context on your own when
    reading through this document. You will need to broaden the meaning of
    individual portions to adapt it to your environment. In some cases, such as
    the use case of a server that is exposed to the Internet, this document may
    even be insufficient or incomplete; however, it may still serve as a good
    starting point on your journey toward an increased level of confidence that
    your system will behave like you want it to.
   </p><p>
    About trust: Trust relationships exist among all systems that participate
    in networked transactions. In this way, the trust relationship between the
    people that use the systems is transported across these systems. The chain
    that is formed by your trust relationships is only as strong as the weakest
    link. It is good practice to graphically visualize the trust relationships
    with the services in a schematic overview or map of your network.
    Generally, it is up to the owner of a resource to enforce the policies
    imposed on that resource; this would usually be the server that provides
    the resource. The client that opens a connection to request the resource
    can only be made responsible for the actions that it performs. This refers
    to the action of opening the connection to start with, but to nothing else
    as such.
   </p><p>
    The case of hostile users is special and unique: The Human Resources
    department may be able to solve some security problems in your computing
    environment; in addition, some technical measures can be taken. Make sure
    that the necessary regulations in your environment fit your needs, and that
    they back your intentions instead of obstructing them if you need to work
    around a missing support from your HR department (and your management).
   </p><p>
    Persons that have administrative privileges on a system are automatically
    considered trusted.
   </p><p>
    A Linux system—without any additional security frameworks such as
    SELinux—is a single level security system: From a security policy
    perspective there is only the superuser (root) and non-privileged users.
    System users are non-root user IDs that have access to files specific to
    their purpose. The separation of administrative duties is complicated by
    this simplicity. Some tools help: Use sudo(8) for administrative tasks, but
    be aware that after the privilege boundary is crossed, a program running
    with root privileges does not enforce any file access policies for
    non-privileged users anymore. vi(1) that runs as root can read and write to
    any file in the system.
   </p><p>
    Another tool to mitigate the risk of abuse or accidental misuse of
    administrative privileges is NetIQ's Privileged User Manager product. More
    information is available here:
   </p><div class="itemizedlist "><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem "><p>
      <a class="link" href="https://www.netiq.com/products/privileged-user-manager/" target="_blank">https://www.netiq.com/products/privileged-user-manager/</a>
     </p></li></ul></div><p>
    Physical security of the server is another assumption made here, where the
    server is protected from theft and manipulation by unauthorized persons. A
    common sobering thought among security professionals is the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">ten-second Denial of Service</span>”</span>: Unplug the wires and reboot
    the server. Physical security must be ensured and physical access must be
    controlled. Otherwise, all assumptions about at least the availability of
    these systems are void.
   </p><div id="idm140331118165024" class="admonition note normal"><img class="symbol" alt="Note" title="Note" src="static/images/icon-note.png" /><h6>Note: Cryptography</h6><p>
     The use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality of transactions
     with the services that your system provides is generally encouraged. The
     need to implement cryptographic enhancements is strongly dependent on the
     operational environments of all participating systems. Keep in mind that
     you need to verify all of the possible security benefits that cryptography
     can provide, for all of your services, and that these benefits are not
     delivered automatically by turning on the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">encrypt</span>”</span> option of
     your service (if you can enjoy the idyllic situation where encryption is
     available as a button to check):
    </p><div class="variablelist "><dl class="variablelist"><dt id="idm140331142665248"><span class="term ">Confidentiality</span></dt><dd><p>
        Protection against reading the content of a transaction
       </p></dd><dt id="idm140331142663488"><span class="term ">Privacy</span></dt><dd><p>
        Protection against knowing that a transaction exists, and some
        properties that it may have, such as size, identities of involved
        parties, their presence, etc.
       </p></dd><dt id="idm140331142661520"><span class="term ">Integrity</span></dt><dd><p>
        Protection against alteration of content. Be aware that cryptography
        does not automatically provide this kind of protection.
       </p></dd><dt id="idm140331137823216"><span class="term ">Authenticity</span></dt><dd><p>
        Protection against identity fraud. Cryptography that does not know
        about identities of participating entities cannot deliver this value.
       </p></dd></dl></div><p>
     Keep in mind that encryption of data for confidentiality purposes can
     merely reduce the size of the data to protect from the actual size to the
     size of the key that is used to encrypt the data. This results in a key
     exchange problem for encrypted transactions, and in a key management
     problem for encrypted data storage. Since data is (typically, there are
     exceptions!) processed in clear, you need your vault unlocked while data
     within is being worked with. The encryption of such data on the file
     system or block device layer helps against the theft of the system, but it
     does not help the confidentiality of the data while the system is running.
    </p></div><p>
    If you want to implement a consistent security policy covering multiple
    hosts on a network then organizational procedures <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span>
    ensure that all those hosts can be trusted and are configured with
    compatible security configurations enforcing an organization wide security
    policy. Isolation of groups of systems that maintain data of the same trust
    domain can provide an adequate means of control; ultimately, the access
    controls to these systems, both for end users and for other systems, need
    to be carefully designed, configured, inspected and monitored.
   </p><div id="idm140331137818384" class="admonition important normal"><img class="symbol" alt="Important" title="Important" src="static/images/icon-important.png" /><h6>Important: Trusting Data</h6><p>
     Data can only be trusted to the degree that is associated with the domain
     it comes from. If data leaves the domain in which security policies can be
     enforced, it should consequently be associated with the trust of the
     target domain.
    </p></div><p>
    For a review of industry best practices on security, the development of
    sound security processes, controls, development, reviews, audit practices
    and incident management, you can review a public RFC (request for
    comments). RFC 2196 is the ongoing work of the world-wide community and
    individual security and process experts. You can review it online here:
    <a class="link" href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2196.html" target="_blank">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2196.html</a>. An RFC is an
    open and living document that invites comments and review. Enhancements and
    improvements are welcome; you will find instructions on where to send those
    suggestions within the document itself.
